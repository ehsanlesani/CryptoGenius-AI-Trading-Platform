"""
ðŸ“ˆ LSTM Time Series Forecaster â€“ Under Development

This script is designed for short-term forecasting tasks in financial markets,
such as predicting the price of a stock or cryptocurrency 30 to 240 minutes ahead.

It sets up the required libraries and environment for building an LSTM-based deep learning model
using TensorFlow and Keras. The model will be trained on time series data with multiple features,
and later integrated into a real-time signal generation pipeline.
